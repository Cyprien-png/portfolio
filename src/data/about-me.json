I loved drawing, tinkering, and most of my sentences started with \"how\" or \"why.\" At a fairly young age, I received my first video game console, and that day, something was born inside me. \"How does Mario know I want him to jump?\", \"Why does the game crash when I do this action in that spot?\", \"How does this Wi-Fi thing let me play with my friends?\""

        "description": "When I reached my teenage years, I left my parents’ home to live in the mountains and start an apprenticeship in computer science. There, I learned about systems and networking, as well as the basics of software development. At the end of my apprenticeship, I decided to pursue more advanced studies in development, where I learned to master every aspect related to software engineering and team management (coding, DevOps, a bit of data science and cybersecurity) but most importantly, I became capable of taking on any challenge."
